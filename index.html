		It was from my first year at college I wrote first computer program. Ever since then,
writing code and loving technology was becoming a wonderful tryout for me even though I failed more than I can ever think of trying.
I discovered how to sync my daily activities with my most important goals and priorities. Since then, my life has never been the same.
Interested to become core part of growing teams with my interest and knowledge on Data Science and Full Stack development.
Happy and honoured to work on research hot startups aiming for a long-term commitment.
My ability to communicate and lead small teams would be used in the best way.
