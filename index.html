		It was from my first year at college I wrote first computer program. Ever since then,
writing code and loving technology was becoming a wonderful tryout for me even though I failed more than I can ever think of trying.
I discovered how to sync my daily activities with my most important goals and priorities. Since then, my life has never been the same. <br>
Interested to become core part of growing teams, connections and interactions made during my participation as member at Free and Open Source Club in my campus(FOSS@Amrita) and Developer Student Clubs Lead, supported by Google
Developers helped my to interact and realize opportunities in developer community and its great ability to shape needs and thoughts of future developers. This also helped me to closely identify
and work with talented people inside and other of campuses.
